
TO DO
- Implement evolution chains
    NOTE

    - A pokemon's evolution will not necessarely be the next entry in the pokedex (eg. electabuzz and electakid)

    - Some pokemon have no evolutions

- Implement a search function
    NOTE
    - Must allow search by name and ID number

    NOTE
    - Must allow quick filter by region
